# password-generator

## Description

Using starter code, I wrote the functions that would generate a password from available characters depending on user input. Once a user clicks the "generate password" a prompt box will then guide them through choosing their parameters (e.g., "Do you want numbers in your password?"). Users MUST choose a length between 8 to 128 characters. Users MUST also have letters in their passwords. They can choose between having both uppercase and lowercase letters or just lowercase or uppercase.
